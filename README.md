<p class="ui header product-top-header" title=" Program 2 Solution">This is  graphical program

Main Idea: You are using if/else or else if statements to make decisions.

·         In this program, you are going to create a simulated Baseball swing. You are going to determine whether a hit is made or not.

·         You are going to build a graphical program that has a

o   Frame

o   Panel

o   and Baseball class.

§  In the Baseball class, you should have four attributes,

·         Hit

·         Foul

·         Strike

·         And ball

o   Your panel should contain

§  a label for a picture

§  a label for the number of hits

§  a label for the number of fouls

§  and a label for the number of strikes

§  a label for the number of balls

§  and a button.

·         When the button is clicked

o   it should randomly decide if it is a hit

o   a foul ball

o   ball

o   or a strike

§  The correct image (of your choice) should appear indicating this.

·         If it is a hit

o   increase the hit attribute

·         If it is a foul

o   increase the foul attribute

·         If it is a ball

o   increase the ball attribute

·         If it is a strike

o   increase the strike attribute.

When the user presses the button, update the display with the overall number of hits, fouls, balls, and strikes.
